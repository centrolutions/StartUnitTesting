# Start Unit Testing

Before you look at the code in the "main" branch, change to the "start" branch.

The following command will download a version of the project you can modify and practice with.

```cs
git clone -b start https://github.com/centrolutions/StartUnitTesting.git
```

If you are only interested in the final, solved project, you can view the code in the "main" branch.
